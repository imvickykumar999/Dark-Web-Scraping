It looks like your `torrc` configuration file is set up to handle some Tor-related tasks, but it does not include the necessary SOCKS and Control ports configuration. You need to ensure that the Tor service is configured to listen on the correct ports. 

Here are the steps to modify your `torrc` file:

1. **Add SOCKS and Control Ports:**
   Open your `torrc` file and add the following lines to ensure that Tor is listening on the necessary ports:

   ```
   SOCKSPort 9050
   ControlPort 9051
   ```

2. **Save the Configuration:**
   Save the changes to your `torrc` file and restart the Tor service to apply the new configuration.

3. **Verify the Tor Configuration:**
   Make sure your `torrc` file looks something like this:

   ```plaintext
   # This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it, comments will not be preserved
   # The old torrc file was renamed to torrc.orig.1, and Tor will ignore it

   ClientOnionAuthDir C:/Users/surface/Desktop/Tor Browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/onion-auth
   DataDirectory C:/Users/surface/Desktop/Tor Browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor
   GeoIPFile C:/Users/surface/Desktop/Tor Browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/geoip
   GeoIPv6File C:/Users/surface/Desktop/Tor Browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/geoip6
   HiddenServiceDir C:/Users/surface/Documents/GitHub/DarkWeb-Flask-CRUD/HiddenServiceDir
   HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:9151

   SOCKSPort 9050
   ControlPort 9051
   ```

4. **Restart Tor:**
   After modifying and saving the `torrc` file, restart the Tor Browser or the Tor service to apply the new configuration.

5. **Check Tor Logs:**
   If the issue persists, check the Tor logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what is going wrong. This can help you identify and fix any configuration issues.

Once you have ensured that Tor is correctly configured and running, you can test your Python script again:

```python
from requests_tor import RequestsTor

# Initialize the RequestsTor object
requests = RequestsTor(tor_ports=(9050,), tor_cport=9051)

url = 'http://ziksbo7eq74itlcfzngr6lrrggotqzsjago5fodrth73ktmvefigb6qd.onion'

# Make a GET request through Tor
r = requests.get(url)

# Print the response text
print(r.text)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to establish a connection to the .onion site using the `requests_tor` library. If you encounter any further issues, please let me know!

Given that the Tor service and the website you're trying to access are running on another laptop, you'll need to ensure that your current laptop is correctly configured to route requests through the Tor network to reach the other laptop. Here are the steps to ensure everything is configured correctly:

### Configuration Steps

1. **Ensure Tor is Running on Both Laptops:**
   - Make sure the Tor service is running on both the current laptop (where you're running the script) and the other laptop (where the Tor website is hosted).

2. **Verify the Tor Service Ports:**
   - Ensure the Tor service on the other laptop is correctly configured to expose the hidden service and that it's accessible through the .onion address.

3. **Network Configuration:**
   - Ensure that there are no network restrictions (such as firewalls) that might be preventing the laptops from communicating through the Tor network.

4. **Correctly Configure the RequestsTor Object:**
   - Ensure your `RequestsTor` object is correctly configured to use the Tor service. You may need to specify the correct ports and possibly the IP address of the laptop running the Tor service.

### Example Script Update

Here is an example of how to configure and run your script, ensuring the Tor service is correctly set up and running:

```python
# pip install requests_tor
from requests_tor import RequestsTor

# Initialize the RequestsTor object
# Ensure tor_ports and tor_cport are correctly specified
requests = RequestsTor(tor_ports=(9050,), tor_cport=9051)

# URL of the Tor hidden service
url = 'http://7ravv2cin5iyoyszsg6sobpp4jsgtyp5r5tpacmuyvadjjyhdwjzgxyd.onion/'

try:
    # Make a GET request through Tor
    r = requests.get(url)
    
    # Save the response text to a file
    with open('output.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write(r.text)
    
    print("Output saved to output.txt")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Additional Debugging Steps

1. **Check Tor Logs:**
   - Check the Tor logs on both laptops to see if there are any errors or warnings that might indicate what is wrong. Logs can usually be found in the `DataDirectory` specified in your `torrc` file.

2. **Use `curl` for Testing:**
   - You can also test the connection using `curl` with the SOCKS5 proxy to ensure the Tor network routing is working:
     ```sh
     curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 http://7ravv2cin5iyoyszsg6sobpp4jsgtyp5r5tpacmuyvadjjyhdwjzgxyd.onion/
     ```

3. **Firewall and Network Configuration:**
   - Ensure that both laptops can communicate over the necessary ports and that there are no firewalls blocking the Tor connections.

4. **Ensure Hidden Service is Correctly Configured:**
   - Double-check the hidden service configuration on the other laptop to ensure it is correctly exposing the service and that it is accessible.

### Conclusion

By following these steps and ensuring that both Tor services are running correctly on both laptops, you should be able to route requests through the Tor network to access the hidden service. If you continue to face issues, please provide more details about the configurations and any error messages you encounter for further assistance.

When fetching a webpage using requests (or any HTTP library), only the HTML content of the page is fetched by default. The additional resources like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc., are not fetched automatically. If you need the complete rendered content, including CSS, you will need to fetch and process these additional resources manually.

Here's a more comprehensive way to handle this:

1. **Fetch the HTML content.**
2. **Parse the HTML to extract URLs for CSS and other resources.**
3. **Fetch these resources and integrate them into the HTML.**

This process can be quite complex if done manually, so using a library like `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML and `requests` for fetching additional resources can be very helpful. Here's an example of how you might do this:

### Example Code

1. **Install necessary libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests_tor beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Fetch and process the webpage:**
   ```python
   from requests_tor import RequestsTor
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   import os

   requests = RequestsTor(tor_ports=(9050,), tor_cport=9051)
   url = 'http://7ravv2cin5iyoyszsg6sobpp4jsgtyp5r5tpacmuyvadjjyhdwjzgxyd.onion/'

   def fetch_and_save(url, session, folder='resources'):
       response = session.get(url)
       if not os.path.exists(folder):
           os.makedirs(folder)
       file_path = os.path.join(folder, os.path.basename(url))
       with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
           f.write(response.content)
       return file_path

   def fetch_page(url):
       response = requests.get(url)
       if response.status_code == 200:
           soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
           
           # Process and save CSS files
           for link in soup.find_all('link', rel='stylesheet'):
               css_url = link.get('href')
               if css_url.startswith('http'):
                   css_file = fetch_and_save(css_url, requests)
                   link['href'] = css_file
               elif css_url.startswith('/'):
                   css_file = fetch_and_save(url + css_url, requests)
                   link['href'] = css_file

           # Process and save JS files
           for script in soup.find_all('script', src=True):
               js_url = script.get('src')
               if js_url.startswith('http'):
                   js_file = fetch_and_save(js_url, requests)
                   script['src'] = js_file
               elif js_url.startswith('/'):
                   js_file = fetch_and_save(url + js_url, requests)
                   script['src'] = js_file

           # Save the modified HTML
           with open('output.html', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
               file.write(str(soup))

           print("Page and resources saved successfully.")
       else:
           print(f"Failed to fetch the page. Status code: {response.status_code}")

   fetch_page(url)
   ```

### Explanation

1. **`fetch_and_save` function:** This function fetches a resource and saves it to a specified folder. The resource could be a CSS file, JavaScript file, image, etc.
2. **`fetch_page` function:** This function fetches the main HTML page and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse it. It looks for CSS and JavaScript files and fetches them using the `fetch_and_save` function. The HTML is then modified to reference the local copies of these files.
3. **Save the modified HTML:** The modified HTML with local references to CSS and JavaScript files is saved to an output file.

This example assumes that CSS and JS files are accessible via direct URLs. If they are not, or if there are other complexities (like relative paths), additional handling will be required. 

This approach ensures that all resources are fetched and saved locally, allowing the HTML to be rendered correctly with all styles and scripts in place.
